# TweakCord

A customization site that allows users to modify the Discord interface through CSS tweaks.

This project is in beta testing. If you would like to help, message me on Discord @hnml.

## Features

- Multiple customization options for Discord UI
- Mix and match tweaks to create personalized themes
- Automatic CSS compilation of selected tweaks
- Web interface for easy tweak selection

## #css-snippets

This project is based on the work of people on #css-snippets on Vencords discord server. In the description of the channel it says

> By posting in this channel you agree to license your css snippet under the https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/ license, which means anyone is allowed to use your snippet however they like with no attribution.

However, I have attributed the used code to the original authors. If you would like to remove your code from this repo, please contact me on discord.

## Privacy

This project does not collect any data. You are free to download the tweaks and use them locally, however they will not be updated with new classes.

## TODO list

- add missing images
- overhaul the UI
- organize tweaks into folders (tabs)
- add some themes as a proof of concept
- remake the readme

## Notice

This project is independant and was in developement before the release of https://github.com/abbie/discord-css [(message)](https://discord.com/channels/1015060230222131221/1028106818368589824/1373627680980861089).

Some ideas may have been taken accidentally, that is the nature of a human brain.

There are many differences between the two projects. Compiling the CSS using only the configured tweaks and using direct classes is way more perfomant than using [class] selectors. Additionally splitting the CSS into multiple files is easier to maintain and distribute than a single massive file.

No hate to the author, the concept of creating multiple tweaks is bound to be explored by someone other than me.
